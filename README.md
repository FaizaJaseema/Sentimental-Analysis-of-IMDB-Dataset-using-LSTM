Built and trained an LSTM-based deep learning model on the IMDB movie review dataset to classify reviews as positive or negative.
Key steps included data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, using pre-trained GloVe embeddings, and evaluating performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
This project strengthened my skills in NLP, deep learning (RNN/LSTM), Python (Keras/TensorFlow), and data visualization.
